## Part 1: Random pet provider (gh repo) challenge

### The Task

1. Create sample terraform code using each of the requirements.
2. Upload to github repo and make sure to create/update README.md file.
3. Code should be simple, tested and working.

**This repo contains a simple code which illustrates one of the use cases of the random_pet resource. In this example we have a S3 bucket which instead of hardcoded name uses the random_pet resource. In the current configuration, it generates a random pet names which consists of 4 words.**

More information for the resource can be found in the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/pet).
