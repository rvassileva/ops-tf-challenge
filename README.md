## Part 1: Random provider (gh repo) challenge

### The Task

1. Create sample terraform code using each of the requirements.
2. Upload to github repo and make sure to create/update README.md file.
3. Code should be simple, tested and working.

**This repo contains a simple code which illustrates one of the use cases of the random provider. In this example we have an EC2 instance which instead of hardcoded name uses interpolation via the random_string resource. In the current configuration, it generates a string with random letters and numbers containing upper letters and no special characters.**
